# Module 10A – Profile Component with State and Props

## What This Is
This is a React project where I made a profile card for someone special. It shows their name, job, a fun fact, and lets you click a button to see more about them.

## What I Learned
- How to send info into a component using props
- How to use useState to show or hide stuff
- How to add buttons that make the app do things

## Why It’s Personal
I built this for Brigitte Williams, someone I care about. It’s not just coding — it’s telling her story in a simple way.
